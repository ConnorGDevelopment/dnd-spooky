# Session 1

Each character woke up in their desolate huts and shacks which lie just past the division of the Bleaks and Orbis and independently made the short fifteen minute walk to the Foultooth Inn. Upon Arrival, they found that the door to the inn was locked and spent a brief moment making introductions after which a voice behind the door asked them to present the wax seals from their letters.

After confirming the individuals each had their seals, a man dressed in an entirely black three-piece suit opened the door and invited them to sit a table. While entering the inn, the party saw a woman behind the bar wearing a black hoop skirt and a black opaque face shield with her hand entirely through the chest of the innkeeper, Edgar Crowfolly. The man told the party to not be alarmed at the sight of this and that they would fix him after their meeting. After asking the party to gather around a table, the man introduced himself as 'Reaper'.

    Edgar Crowfolly
    Description: 
    A thin, middle-aged Dwarven man that owns and operates the Foultooth Inn. The left side of his face is badly disfigured from a childhood accident where he fell from a suspended walkway onto a metal post. In Dwarven society, he is considered a disgrace because of his frailty and for having a facial scar that was not earned in combat.
    Social Status: Discriminated

    Reaper
    Description:
    A tall man with a very gaunt, pale face that seems almost juxtapositioned on his strong, athletic body. His race is strangely indistinguishable, he has the features of many races but none of their defining features. His muscular hands and broad shoulders seem almost Dwarven, his skin has a slight shimmer in the light like an Elf, his sharp jawline is adorned with a modest speckling of facial hair like a Human.
    Social Status: Unknown

Reaper explained that his investigation lead him to Deadyarn and that he believes Baron Alderman was killed here. He presented the party with his most recent clue, a heavily-gnawed rawhide bone. Reaper then announced that he and 'Marzia', the woman at the bar, would be leaving. The group then watched Marzia remove her hand from Edgar's chest and as she did a bright white light began to emit from the wound until it filled the room and blinded the party. When the party regained their vision, Edgar and Marzia had disappeared.

    Marzia
    Description:
    A fit woman of slightly above average height. Her outfit completely conceals her face and skin. The only information that could be gleaned about her was the absence of the rising and falling motion of the chest that is commonly associated with breathing.
    Social Status: Unknown

Upon inspection, Maya was able to determine that the bite patterns belonged to a mid-size canine with extensively damaged teeth. Baxter then determined that they should head towards the outskirts of town because if the animal was domestic, the owner could only afford to keep it if it was a hunting animal, and if it wasn't domestic, then it would have to be from the forests beyond Deadyarn.

When the group arrived at the forest's edge, Maya used her wild shape to turn into a wolf and found a handful of canine footprints mixed among several other tracks and followed them north. As they moved deeper into the forest, they spotted a tree with a humanoid figure in the branches. Once they got closer, they saw that the figure was a horribly mutilated body wearing nobleman clothes smattered with blood, tar, and vomit. They also noticed stitching around the neck which strongly indicated that this was not the head that belonged to this body and that the body had been crudely affixed to the tree with a series of swords, nails, and spikes. They also saw that this tree was part of a large circle of trees that enclosed a small clearing, and that three other trees had bodies mounted to them. Baxter and Melia carefully went to examine the other bodies and found they were similarly disfigured but each had their original heads.

The party then slowly entered the clearing where they saw a large triangle had been made by staining the soil with blood. Baxter's knowledge of the occult left him confused because a triangle circumscribed by a circle isn't a complete symbol, without more details its meaningless. He also realized that the positioning of the bodies was meaningless and the corpses weren't mounted in any significant way and they weren't killed with the precision of a ritual.

    In clock positions, the bodies were placed between the four and five o'clock positions, six o'clock position, nine o'clock position, and between the eleven and twelve o'clock positions. 

While he pondered, Maya approached the center of the circle. Everyone watched as Maya started digging at the center and heard the noise of her paws striking a hollow object. Sparrow called for her to stop and come back, to which she didn't reply. Tightly gripping the handles of Baxter's wheelchair and filled with a growing concern, Melia called out to Maya, which did catch her attention.

From Maya's perspective, she saw Melia patting on her thighs as if she wanted Maya to jump up on to her like a loving pup. Everyone else watched in horror as Maya dashed over, scaled over Baxter, and turned her head sideways to bite the face of Melia. Luckily, Melia quickly thought to put up an arcane shield and a pair of ghostly purple hands grabbed Maya's jaws and held them at bay. Maya quickly snapped out of her trance and her wild shape as the memory of what actually happened caught up with her.

Then suddenly, six undead of an unknown type burst from the ground. Each of them wrapped in rotting linen and leather with their arms crossed in front of their chest and holding a sickle in either hand. 

Baxter threw himself from his wheelchair and the party watched as his frail body began to convulse and grow, muscles swelling to the point where his skin ripped in places. Within seconds, a behemoth stood before them, emanating a blistering heat. With a roar and a leap, he began crushing enemies with his grotesque swollen hands.

One of the undead quickly leapt at Melia, scoring a deep cut across her chest. The outraged Melia hastily undid the leather bindings on her left arm, revealing that her forearm is tattooed all the way around with an intricate and indecipherable script. She grabbed the face of the creature as the script began to shine with a brilliant violet color, killing the foe immediately and healing the wound on her arm.

Ambrose drew his blade and began to slash at one of the unsightly abominations. As he struggled to make contact with his blade, a panicked and pacifistic Maya managed to cover his flank by halting a ghoul with a series of vines.

Sparrow, with her own undead to duel, watched curiously as Ambrose stepped in two different directions at once. Ambrose had seemingly duplicated himself and Sparrow used this opportunity to cut the monster from gut to throat. Having dispatched her quarry, she then reached past Ambrose and dealt a lethal blow to his opponent as well. As Ambrose turned to assess the situation and find his next target, he noticed that Sparrow held no weapons and it baffled him.

As the final enemy fell, the ground began to rumble. Then where Maya had been digging moment prior, a stone sarcophagus lid burst from the earth sailing several hundreds of feet into the air, almost taking Maya with it. From that sarcophagus, a skeleton draped in tattered black robes emerged and began to swing at Maya. Maya felt its bony fingers graze across her face and watched as a myriad of ephemeral violet chains streaked from her peripheral vision and bind to the face of skeleton. Melia had succesfully landed a witchbolt and as her magic burned away the hood of the creature, a face with large eye sockets and bony tentacles was revealed. 

Maya stood stunned as she felt the weight of this creature's mind. Unlike the mindless dead they had just faced, this creature had a consciousness, and it relished the pain and hatred it was feeling. Luckily, it had no chance to capitalize on here catatonia. Ambrose was already by her side and landed a fierce lunge into its chest before a dark shadow appeared above the creature moments before the massive fists of Baxter coming down upon its head.

As a horrible wail came from the creature, everyone watched as a thin crack appeared in the center of its head and turned to see Sparrow standing with arm outstretched, holding only a deck of tarot cards.

With the beast felled, Ambrose now filled with an even mix of frustration and bewilderment, asked how Sparrow could have possibly done that with a mere card. Sparrow responded only by shrugging and firmly planting a card into the trunk of a tree. With Maya still shuddering and Baxter's consciousness absent, Melia slowly approached the body as she identified what the creature was in life.

A Mindflayer.
