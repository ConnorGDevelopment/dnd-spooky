# From the Introduction Document

## Medietas, Orbis, and the Bleaks
Amberfall is a city roughly the size of Texas. 

In the middle of Amberfall is Medietas (Me-dee-a-tas), an area roughly the size of New York City. It is filled with spires of beautiful and space-efficient vertical housing and expansive parks filled with verdant grass and lush trees. The homes themselves look like stacked greenhouses with walls made completely of glass. The denizens of the Medietas love watching the light filter through the panels of the eco-dome, a giant arcane construct standing high above the city that filters out pollution and lets the sun and stars shine through. No one minds that their homes have glass walls, because why would you need privacy in Medietas? If you live in Medietas, you're a good person so there's nothing you would need to do behind closed doors. At the very center of Medietas stands the Great Court, a massive structure that is even more massive on the inside because of its non-Euclidean geometry.

Outside Medietas is Orbis. Orbis doesn't enjoy the same luxuries of Medietas, but that's because the people there don't deserve it. Orbis exists in a state of constant night because its sky is a thick blanket of smog. Seeing a star in Orbis is as rare as seeing a shooting star in our world. The buildings of Orbis look like a post-apocalyptic Steampunk London. Factories billow out black plumes to further feed the smog above and broken streetlights shoot sparks of arcane energy towards its cobblestone streets. The only thing more present than despair in Orbis are the Police, who serve a noble duty fighting back the reach of the Criminal Underworld and the screaming masses of undesirables.

And on the very edge of Orbis are the Bleaks. The Bleaks are where society, somehow, found a way to fall apart more than they did in Orbis. People living in the Bleaks live simple peasant lives in delapidated huts atop swampy fields. Everyone in the Bleaks wishes for a chance to move to Orbis and have a chance at better life, unknowing that they dream for a different flavor of misery. The culture of the Bleaks has diverged so much that many believe Medietas is the afterlife instead of a real place. And in the Bleaks, only two things send you to the afterlife: disease and raiders. The only nice thing to be said about Orbis is that they have some level of protection that the Bleaks do not. The Bleaks are constantly fending off attacks from the Places Beyond where the monsters live. Every good Bleak citizens sleeps with a pitchfork and torch within arms reach.

Throughout all of Amberfall there is a pervasive fear of that which is different. If people think you're too strange or you perform magic without a license, you'll get the most fearsome Police task force sent after you, the Witchkillers. Everyone yearns to be worthy of living in Medietas, whether they believe it is the afterlife or not.

Your story starts in Deadyarn, a district that stands half in Orbis and half in the Bleaks. Each of you is a disgraceful derelict in society, each of you holds some macabre profession or dark secret, each of you lives in constant fear of the Witchkillers. And yet, each of you received ornate letter tucked under the door of you whatever hovel you call home, written on perfectly white paper with deep violet ink. The seal on the letter is emblazoned with a letter 'R' but with subtle detailing to appear as if it were made of finger bones.

The letter reads as follows:

*Dear Lost Soul,*

I will not tell you my name as that would simply condemn me to living an existence not unlike your own. I require your *unique* talents in investigating the death of a certain Baron Alderman. If you prove useful in this, I will reward you with a promotion to a district closer to Medietas. You may also consider this a trial, if you prove to be an asset, it is within my power to promote you into Medietas. More instructions will be waiting at the Foultooth Inn, along with several others who have received this same letter. I don't suggest you trust them, as I am enlisting them for the same reasons I am enlisting you. But I do suggest your work with them. You will know each other share a cause by presenting the wax seal adorning this letter, assuming you haven't consumed it for sustenance already.

Yours Untruly,

*Reaper*

## Laws Surrounding Magic
The use of magic is illegal without a license, and licenses are only given to people in professions that require the use of magic such as Arcanosmiths or Witchkillers. Having knowledge of magic is not illegal, it is not uncommon to meet people capable of magic, they are simply barred from using it.

In Orbis, where crime is rampant, the use of minor magic won't necessarily cause the Witchkillers to descend upon you. Most people wouldn't be shocked by the discrete use of a cantrip. Flashy or public displays of magic are usually handled by the Police and result in fines or jail time. The Witchkillers are summoned when magic is being used in combat, to manipulate authority, or affect an individual's social standing.

## Medietas
Medietas is the perfect city, or so they say. No one actually knows a lot about this portion of the Amberfall. Laws are declared and disseminated throughout the varying districts. Occasionally, priveleged individuals send mail to denizens of Orbis. But people don't leave, no one leaves Medietas.

## The Witchkillers
The mysterious order of the Witchkillers are the highest form of authority in Orbis and the Bleaks. They wear no uniforms, they have no identities, they have no families or connections. No one knows if they are recruited or if they are trained. No one knows where in Amberfall they come from, some think they come from Medietas while others think they are people plucked from the Bleaks. 

What people do know, is they are invisible yet ever present. The only credible news story involving the Witchkillers comes from the district of Frostlight. A mage there summoned a fire elemental in the middle of town while attempting to assasinate that district's Governor and family. The mage was killed almost instantly when he was struck simultaneously by five disintegrate spells. A shopkeeper reported that he was weighing produce for a pregnant mother when all of sudden she turned and fired a scarlet beam behind her prior to vanishing. A bailiff escorting a convict to their sentencing said that they watched one of the convict's hands phase through their cuffs and fire a similar scarlet beam at the mage prior to vanishing as well.

## Orbissyian Morality
The people of Orbis are in many ways depraved and cruel. Because of the harsh living conditions, citizens engage in a constant social rat race. No one would dare act uncouth in public for fear of being demoted to a district further from the center. But in a dark alley, it would not be suprising to be mugged for money, food or jewelry. It is not uncommon to hear about someone receiving a job promotion after their supervisor mysteriously disappeared.
